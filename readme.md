#Assignment 2 Culling

It can of works, there is some wonky things with the childs nodes and the volume but the culling works.

Controls
WASD for movement
Shift for moving forward
Mouse for the other half of cmaera movement, inverted 
P to toggle cursor on/off, it is pretty weird but it kind of works
Blue are parents green are child nodes

TODO fix the P and the movement, add someway to show the transform of the parent apply to the child nodes
